											<h3>Effect of Benzalkonium Chloride On Urine Mucus Concentration Following Augmentation Ileocystoplasty in Rats – 2005</h3>
											<p>Ileocystoplasty is a popular technique used for treatment of low-capacity urinary
												bladders. One of its major down sides is the ability of the intestinal mucosa to secret mucous, with its related
												urinary complications. Benzalkonium chloride is an irreversible ganglion blocker. Its local application to the
												augmenting ileal patch could reduce the acetyl choline-mediated mucus secretion. The aim of this study was to
												evaluate the effect of benzalkonium chloride on urinary mucus concentration following augmentation
												ileocystoplasty in mice. </p>

											<h3>Role Of NADPH Diaphorase Histochemistry In The Diagnosis Of Hirschsprung’s Disease – 1998</h3>
											<p> The purpose of this study was to investigate the specificity and sensitivity of NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-D) staining in suction rectal biopsies (SRB) to determine whether it can be used as a diagnostic test for Hirschsprung's disease (HD) and related disorders. We studied SRB material in 80 patients suspected of having such disorders taken at 3, 5, and 7 cm above the pectinate line. Eight-micron sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, acetylcholinesterase histochemistry, and NADPH-D histochemistry. Normal biopsy specimens demonstrated strong NADPH-D reactivity in the submucosal ganglia and a large number of NADPH-D-positive fibers in the muscularis mucosae (MM). In contrast, there were no NADPH-D-positive fibers in the MM in patients with HD and hypertrophic nerve trunks stained weakly.</p>

											<h3>Ultrasound Guided Reduction of Primary Intussusceptions Presented With Simple Intestinal Obstruction Using Saline Enema As A New Hydrostatic – Experienced Technique – 1997</h3>
											<p> Intussusception is the telescoping or invagination of a portion of intestine (intussusceptum) into an adjacent segment (intussuscipiens). It is one of the common causes of bowel obstruction in infants and toddlers.1,2,3,4 Though intussusception was first described by Barbette in 16741, it took over three centuries before its sonographic features were described in 19775Many researchers have since used ultrasound to diagnose this condition with a high specificity and sensitivity of nearly 100%.3In 1982, Kim and his group did the first ultrasound guided hydrostatic reduction (USGHR) with normal saline.3 Sonography has now been accepted as a method for guiding hydrostatic reduction of intussusception with tap water, normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution.</p>

														<h3>Anterior Hypospadias Repair _ Experience With Introduction of New Modifications – 2004</h3>
														<p> Hypospadias is one of the most common congenital genital anomalies for which surgery early in life is indicated. The surgical treatment is changing progressively, often by repeating treatment strategies that have been used decades ago. Indeed, historically two-stage procedures were replaced by one-stage procedures and nowadays two-stage procedures gain new interest. The same for reconstructions using the urethral plate, which decades ago were based on the Thiersch Duplay principle. In the 1980s, preputial onlay flaps were most often used and today we see a new interest in the use of the urethral plate. The actual surgical approach to hypospadias is described and technical details are given</p>

															<h3>Pull-Through Procedure For Hirshsprung’s Disease: Transanal or Transabdominal? A comparative Study – 2004</h3>
															<p>To document our experience with the transanal pull-through procedure, to compare its results of with the results of the one-stage open Soave procedure and to compare results one-stage procedures with the gold standard multi-stage. Methods: The prospective part of the study included twenty-eight patients with biopsy-proven HD. The retrospective part of the study included 277 patients treated by Soave multistage procedure. Patients were randomized into; Group A: treated by the transanal pull-through procedure. Group B: treated by the trans-abdominal one-stage Soave pull-through procedure. Group C: treated by Soave multistage procedure. Results: The operative bleeding, the operating time, the onset of oral feeding, the postoperative pain, the hospital stay, the length of follow-up and costs were the only statistically significant variables. Functional results were good in 92.86%, 85.71%, and 88.09% of patients of groups A, B and C respectively. Postoperative complications were seen mainly in groups C then B. For groups A and B, there had been no recurrence of obstructive symptoms. Hospital stay was significantly longer in the groups C and B. Cost was significantly higher in the group C than group B and group A. Conclusions: In selected cases, one stage pull-through operation can be safely done. Transanal technique is superior to open Soave due to its simplicity, cost effectiveness, and less surgical morbidity. It can be tolerated very well in the newborns. The operative technique can be easily mastered. It could be carried out in older children with little morbidity. Long-term follow-up will be required to determine whether early total reconstruction produces better lifelong bowel function than traditional staged repairs. </p>

															<h3>Subpreputial Metal-Pedicled Flap, New Technical Challenge of The Megameatus Hypospadias Variant – 2004 </h3>

															<p> 
																After years of clinical and basic science research, and a high volume of publications,
our knowledge appears to have stagnated regarding this common condition. It is
possible that is related to a parallel stagnation in research methodology. Retrospective
reviews, focusing on ill-defined patient populations, and limited by subjective
assessment or analysis of short-term complications is the rule rather than something
to be avoided. The results are at best difficult to understand and reproduce, and in the
end, of questionable utility. However, a root cause compromising advances in this field,
the elephant-penis in the room, is poor classification.

															<h3> The Anterior Sagittal Anorectoplasty Technique (ASARP) For Treatment of Recto-Vestibular Fistula & Vestibular Anus In Neonates And Children – 2005</h3>

															<p> 
																Many surgical techniques have been described for fu
nctional treatment of vestibular anus, and recto-vestibular fistula in girls. Achievement of good results remains
the main goal of treatment. Anterior sagittal anorectoplasty (ASARP) technique avoids dividing the pelvic floor,
thus promises better postoperative continence. In this study, we evaluated the results of the ASARP technique in
treatment of vestibular anus, and recto-vestibular fistula in neonates and children.

															<h3>Role of Germ Cell Apoptosis And Serum Inhibin (B) As A Prognostic Markers of Fertility In Children With Undescended Testis – 2004 </h3>

															<p> 
																Traditionally, Hirschsprung's disease (HD) was treated in a staged procedure of colostomy, the definitive procedure then closure of colostomy. Eventually many pediatric surgeons became more interested in the one-stage approach, and results have been favorable when compared with a staged procedure. This study aims at evaluation of management of HD using one-stage transanal endorectal pull-through (TEPT) early in the neonatal period.

															<h3>Isolated Torsion of Penis Technique and Review of The Literature – 2003 </h3>

															<p> 
																Standard textbooks suggest that the human penile urethra is formed by fusion from
lateral to medial and that glanular urethra is formed either by ectodermal intrusion
theory or by endodermal transformation. Clinical findings and recent research
challenge these theories and suggest “The Distal Migration Hyposthesis” for urethral
development.
Clinical and histological findings show that the glans penis is well developed in
hypospadias even in patients where the corpus spongiosum is hypoplastic or absent.
This contradicts the classic teaching that the glans penis is the distal part of the corpus
spongiosum.

															<h3>Spontaneous Reduction of Intussusception Avoiding Unnecessar Surgery – 2003 </h3>

															<p> 
																Symptoms suggestive of intussusception were present in 21 (3 of whom had Henoch-Schönlein purpura and 4 had previous ileocolic intussusception reduced by air enema). Intussusception was an incidental finding in the other 29, in 28 of whom the finding was in the small bowel. Intussusception was limited to the small bowel in 43 and was ileocolic in 7. SROI was usually documented on US. Laparotomy performed in only 4 showed no evidence of intussusception or pathologic lead point. Outcome in all patients was favorable.

															<h3> </h3>

															<p> 
																Meconium ileus is one of the gastrointestinal manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF), and affects 15% of neonates. The condition results from the accumulation of sticky inspissated meconium. Both nonoperative and operative therapies may be effective in relieving obstruction. The treatment of choice for uncomplicated meconium ileus is the use of enteral N-acetylcysteine or Gastrografin enemata. Once such therapy fails, surgery is indicated. A number of operative procedures are in use, including Bishop-Koop enterostomy, T-tube irrigation, resection and primary anastomosis, and enterotomy with irrigation and primary closure. During the period 1991-2003, five newborns required surgical intervention for uncomplicated meconium ileus. None responded to conservative management.

															<h3> Evaluation of the Efficacy of the Posterior Midsagittal Approach For Surgical Resection of Low-Sited Intrapelvic Tumors A Prospective Clinical Trial – 2004</h3>

															<p> 	
																Low-sited presacral intrapelvic malignant tumors represent one of the challenging situations for surgeons. Laparotomy alone often does not provide adequate exposure for complete excision of a midline intrapelvic tumor Objective: To evaluate, describe and discuss the use of PMA in the treatment of intrapelvic malignant tumors which are too high to be approached through the perineum and too low to be excised by laparotomy alone
																Patients: A prospective study of eighteen patients suffering from documented malignant Iow-sited intrapelvic tumors. Methods: All patients were subjected to tumor excision through the posterior midsagittal approach. After excision, the rectum was placed in the normal position. The pelvic floor muscles were reconstructed in the midline Results: The size of the completely resected tumors ranged from 2.5 x 4 cm to 7 x 11.5 cm.

															<h3>Post Laparotomy In-Patient Intussusceptions In Infancy and Childhood – 2000 </h3>

															<p> 
																Postoperative intussusception (POI) is an uncommon cause of postoperative mechanical bowel obstruction in children. Four cases of POI during a period of 15 years (1987-2001) were analysed retrospectively. Symptoms developed after a median period of 2.5 days following the operation. All cases were succesfully treated with operative manual reduction. POI occurs after a wide variety of surgical procedures and is often difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are often obscure. As a conclusion, we state that reaching a diagnose requires a high index of suspicion.

															<h3>Retractile Testis Indicated For Orchiopexy . A New Clinical Concept – 2000 </h3>

															<p> 
																The best mode of undescended testis (UDT) treatment remains controversial. However, knowledge gained from randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses allowed different groups of researchers to set out guidelines on management of patients with UDT. The authors reviewed recent literature and came to the following conclusions: (1) Hormonal treatment is not recommended, considering both the immediate results (only 15–20% of retained testes descend) and the possible long-term adverse effects on spermatogenesis. (2) Surgery is the treatment of choice; orchiopexy is successful in about 95% of UDT, with a low rate of complications (about 1%). (3) Orchiopexy should be performed between 12 and 18 months of age, or at first contact if diagnosed later.

															<h3>Length Of Mesentry As A Limiting And Prognostic Factor Of Primary Intussusceptions In Children And Infants – 2000 </h3>

															<p> 
																Intussusception is a condition in which part of the intestine folds into the section next to it. Intussusception usually involves the small bowel and rarely the large bowel. Symptoms include abdominal pain which may wax and wane, vomiting, bloating, and bloody stool. It may result in a small bowel obstruction. Other complications may include peritonitis or bowel perforation.[1][2][3][4]

The cause is typically unknown in children while in adults a lead point due to cancer is often present. Risk factors in children include infections, cystic fibrosis, and intestinal polyps. Risk factors in adults include endometriosis, bowel adhesions, and intestinal tumors. Medical imaging often supports a diagnosis. In children, ultrasound is a preferred the method to diagnose while in adults a CT scan is preferred.

Intussusception requires rapid treatment. Treatment in children is typically by an enema with surgery if not successful. In adults removal of part of the bowel is more often required. Intussusception occurs more commonly in children than adults. In

Intussusception occurs more commonly in children than adults, in children it is more common in males than females. The usual age of occurrence is six to 18 months old.
